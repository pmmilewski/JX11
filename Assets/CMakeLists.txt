# If your target needs extra binary assets, you can add them here. The first argument is the name of
# a new static library target that will include all the binary resources. There is an optional
# `NAMESPACE` argument that can specify the namespace of the generated binary data class. Finally,
# the SOURCES argument should be followed by a list of source files that should be built into the
# static library. These source files can be of any kind (wav data, images, fonts, icons etc.).
# Conversion to binary-data will happen when your target is built.
